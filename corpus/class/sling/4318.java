/**
 * The <code>DEAConstants</code> provides some constants for
 * handling distributed OSGi events.
 * <p>
 * If an event should be sent to other instances, the event
 * property {@link #PROPERTY_DISTRIBUTE} should be set to
 * an empty string.
 * <p>
 * An event, regardless if distributed or not, should never be
 * created with the property {@link #PROPERTY_APPLICATION}. In
 * addition properties starting with "event.dea." are reserved
 * attributes of this implementation and must not be used
 * by custom events.
 * <p>
 * If the event is a local event, the {@link #PROPERTY_APPLICATION}
 * is not available. If it is available, it contains the application
 * (Sling ID) of the instance where the event originated.
